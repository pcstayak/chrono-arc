### User Story 6.3 (UPDATED)

**Number:** `6.3`
**ID:** `BA-US-quiz-game-integration`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to answer multiple-choice quiz questions related to the attacked event so that I can demonstrate my knowledge and defend the event from being corrupted.`

**Context / Background:**
- This story covers the integration and display of the multiple-choice quiz mini-game when an event is attacked
- **UPDATED:** Quiz is now ONE OF FIVE mini-game types (not the only defense mechanism)
- Quiz type is selected by the mini-game selection logic (Story 6.13) when appropriate
- Questions must be generated based on the specific event content that the player could have learned before the attack
- The quiz should feel relevant, fair, and age-appropriate for kids aged 7-12
- Questions should test understanding of key facts, dates, people, and concepts related to the event
- The quiz interface should be simple, focused, and free of distractions
- Educational goal: Use retrieval practice (answering questions from memory) to reinforce learning
- Game goal: Create a sense of challenge and accomplishment when defending an event
- **Quiz is the universal fallback:** If other mini-game types cannot be generated for an event, Quiz is always available

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Load the quiz game component in the right-side column when an event is attacked AND quiz type is selected
2. Generate or retrieve exactly 5 quiz questions related to the attacked event
3. Questions should be based on information the player encountered while exploring the event
4. Display questions one at a time (not all at once)
5. Provide 2-4 answer choices per question (multiple choice format)
6. Ensure exactly one answer is correct per question
7. Use simple, kid-friendly language in questions and answers
8. Display clear instructions at the start: "Defend this event by answering questions correctly"
9. Show progress indicator (e.g., "Question 2 of 5")
10. Questions should cover different aspects of the event (not all about the same detail)
11. Generate unique incorrect answer options for each event's quiz (not reused across different events)
12. Ensure incorrect answers are contextually relevant (from the same era, similar inventions, related concepts)
13. Do not include questions where the answer is the name of the current event being defended (no self-referential questions)
14. Questions should test knowledge ABOUT the event, not just name recognition

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Quiz interface must be readable on both desktop and mobile (responsive layout)
- Answer buttons must be large enough for kids to tap easily on mobile (minimum 40px height)
- Text should use clear, sans-serif font at appropriate size (at least 14px for kids)
- Questions and answers must be concise (avoid long paragraphs)
- Answer choices should be randomized in order to prevent pattern-based guessing
- Correct answer should not be disproportionately in one position (e.g., always "C")
- Interface should feel encouraging, not punitive, even when player is wrong
- Loading questions should not cause noticeable delay (under 1 second)
- Incorrect answers should be plausible enough to require actual knowledge (not obviously wrong)

**Data & State:**
- Inputs:
  - Event ID (to identify which event is being defended)
  - Event content (facts, dates, people, concepts for question generation)
  - Player's exploration history for this event (optional, to ensure questions are fair)
  - Fixed number of questions: 5
  - List of other events in the same era (for generating contextual incorrect answers)
  - Event name/title (to exclude from answer options)
- Outputs:
  - List of 5 generated quiz questions with answer choices
  - Currently displayed question and answers
  - Player's selected answer for each question
  - Progress through the quiz (question X of 5)
- State rules:
  - Quiz generates exactly 5 questions when defense begins (not regenerated if player refreshes)
  - Questions are presented sequentially (cannot skip ahead or go back)
  - Each question must be answered before proceeding to the next
  - Quiz state persists for the duration of the defense session
  - Each event's quiz has unique incorrect answers (not shared with other events' quizzes)

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Event has insufficient content to generate 5 good questions: use a mix of event-specific and era-related questions to reach 5 total
- Event content is very simple (only 1-2 facts): generate questions at varying difficulty (e.g., direct recall + inference) to reach 5 questions
- Player's exploration was minimal: quiz should still be fair, using only content that was definitely visible
- No exploration history available: generate questions from all event content (assume player could have seen it)
- Question text is too long for mobile display: truncate or rephrase to fit within UI constraints
- Answer choices are very similar: ensure choices are distinct enough for kids to differentiate
- All answer choices are obviously wrong except one: ensure distractors are plausible
- Player refreshes browser mid-quiz: should resume from the same question (if state is preserved) or restart (acceptable fallback)
- Not enough events in the same era to generate contextual incorrect answers: fall back to related concepts or nearby eras
- Question generation accidentally creates a self-referential question: validation should detect and regenerate the question
- All questions inadvertently have the same incorrect answers: ensure variety check passes before presenting quiz

**Assumptions:**
- Event content is structured in a way that supports automated question generation (facts, dates, names, etc.)
- A question generation algorithm or library exists or will be built as part of this story
- Alternatively, questions are pre-authored and tagged to events
- The right-side column layout has sufficient space for quiz UI (at least 300px wide on desktop)
- Quiz state can be stored in application state (Redux, Context, or similar) for persistence
- The quiz component is reusable and can be adapted for other events without code changes
- Answer validation is handled by story 6.4 (this story only displays and collects answers)
- Questions are generated in English (localization is out of scope)
- All events have enough content to generate at least 5 reasonable questions
- The game state includes information about which events belong to which era/time period
- There is a database or data structure of related events that can be queried for generating contextual incorrect answers
- The question generation algorithm can access the current event's name/title to exclude it from answer options

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Answer validation logic (covered in story 6.4)
- Determining the final defense outcome (covered in story 6.4)
- Difficulty progression or adaptive questioning
- Hints, lifelines, or help options during the quiz
- Timer or time pressure mechanics
- Scoring beyond pass/fail
- Detailed feedback explaining why an answer was correct or incorrect
- Question authoring UI or content management tools
- Support for question types other than multiple choice (e.g., true/false, fill-in-blank)
- Automatically adjusting question difficulty based on player performance across multiple quizzes
- **NEW:** Selecting which mini-game type to use (covered in story 6.13)

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given an event is attacked AND quiz mini-game type is selected, when I view the event card, then the quiz game loads in the right-side column with clear instructions
- Given the quiz has loaded, when I view the interface, then I see one question displayed with 2-4 answer choices
- Given I am viewing a question, when I look at the answer choices, then they are presented in a random order (not the same order every time)
- Given I am viewing a question, when I select an answer, then my selection is visibly highlighted before proceeding
- Given I have answered a question, when I proceed, then the next question is displayed (if more remain)
- Given I am in the quiz, when I check the interface, then I see a progress indicator showing my position (e.g., "Question 2 of 5")
- Given the event has rich content, when questions are generated, then they cover different aspects of the event (not repetitive)
- Given the event has any amount of content, when questions are generated, then exactly 5 questions are presented
- Given I am on mobile, when I interact with the quiz, then all text is readable and buttons are easy to tap
- Given the quiz is in progress, when I view the interface, then I can clearly see which question I am on out of 5 total
- Given I am defending Event A, when I view the quiz, then the incorrect answer options are different from those in Event B's quiz
- Given two different events in the same era, when I compare their quizzes, then each has unique incorrect answers relevant to their specific context
- Given I am defending an event, when I view quiz questions, then none of the questions have the current event's name as an answer option
- Given I am defending "The Printing Press", when I view the quiz, then I do not see a question like "What is the name of this invention?" with "The Printing Press" as an option
- Given I am defending an event, when incorrect answers are generated, then they reference other events from the same era or related historical/scientific concepts
- Given an event is in the Renaissance era, when incorrect answers are generated, then they might include other Renaissance inventions, not random unrelated items

**Integration with Other Epic 6 Stories:**
- **6.13 (Mini-Game Type Selection):** Quiz type is selected when event content doesn't strongly match other mini-game types, or as variety fallback
- **6.4 (Answer Validation):** Quiz answers are validated same way as other mini-game types
- Quiz serves as the **universal fallback** when other mini-game types cannot be generated
