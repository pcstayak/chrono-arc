### User Story 2.2

**Number:** `2.2`
**ID:** `BA-US-render-event-dots`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see dots positioned along the timeline arc representing historical events so that I can identify individual events and understand their chronological relationships.`

**Context / Background:**
- Each dot represents one historical event or invention
- Dots are positioned at specific points along the arc curve based on their date
- For MVP, we'll have 5-10 sample events with pre-calculated positions
- Dots must be visually distinct and large enough for kids to interact with

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Render circular dots at specified positions along the arc curve
2. Each dot should be clearly visible against the arc and footer background
3. Dots should be evenly spaced or positioned according to their historical date
4. Dots should have a consistent size (approximately 12-16px diameter on desktop, 10-14px on mobile)
5. Dots should have a base color indicating their state (for MVP, all dots are "safe" - use a single neutral color)

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Dots must be clearly visible (use fill color and optional stroke)
- Dots should be large enough to be tappable on mobile (expand tap target to ~32px even if visual dot is smaller)
- Dot color should contrast with both the arc line and the footer background
- Dots should be rendered on top of the arc line (layering)
- Spacing between dots should be sufficient to avoid overlap (minimum 20px gap on desktop, 15px on mobile)

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Array of event objects with `{id, name, date, arcPosition}` where `arcPosition` is a percentage (0-100) along the arc
- Outputs: Rendered dots on the arc
- State rules: Dots are static in MVP (no animations or state changes)

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Two events very close in time: ensure dots don't overlap; adjust spacing if necessary
- Very few events (1-2): dots should still be visible and not look lost on the arc
- Very many events (20+): may need to implement overflow or compression (out of scope for MVP; cap at 10 events)
- Missing position data: use fallback position or don't render that dot

**Assumptions:**
- MVP will have 5-10 sample events with pre-defined positions
- Event positions are provided as percentages (0 = start of arc, 100 = end of arc)
- All dots are in "safe" state for MVP (single color, no animations)
- Dots are circles (not custom shapes)

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Interactive hover effects (covered in story 2.3)
- Click interactions (covered in story 2.4)
- Dot state colors (danger, attack) - deferred to future iteration
- Dot animations (pulse, shake) - deferred to future iteration
- Era grouping or clustering of dots

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given the timeline has event data, when the arc renders, then I see circular dots positioned along the curve at appropriate locations
- Given I view the arc on desktop, when I look closely, then dots are clearly visible with consistent size and color
- Given I view the arc on mobile, when the page loads, then dots are visible and appropriately sized for touch interaction
- Given two events are close together, when the dots render, then they are distinguishable and do not overlap
