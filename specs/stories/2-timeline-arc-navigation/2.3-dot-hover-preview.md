### User Story 2.3

**Number:** `2.3`
**ID:** `BA-US-dot-hover-preview`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player using a desktop browser, I want to see a preview of an event card when I hover over a dot on the arc so that I can quickly browse events without committing to a selection.`

**Context / Background:**
- Hover previews help players explore the timeline quickly
- When hovering over a dot, the left card panel should show a temporary preview of that event's card
- If the player moves to a different dot, the preview updates
- If the player moves away from all dots, the preview clears (or reverts to the last selected card)
- This is a desktop-only feature; mobile uses tap-to-select directly

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Detect when the mouse hovers over a dot on the arc
2. Load and display the corresponding event card in the left column as a preview
3. Update the preview if the hover moves to a different dot
4. Clear or revert the preview if the hover moves away from all dots
5. Provide a slight delay (e.g., 200-300ms) before showing the preview to avoid flickering when moving the mouse quickly
6. Preview should be visually distinguishable from a selected card (e.g., lighter background, "Preview" label, or different border)

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Hover detection should be smooth and responsive
- Preview should load quickly (no noticeable lag)
- Transition between previews should be smooth (fade or slide)
- Preview should not permanently lock the left column (only clicking should lock)
- On mobile/touch devices, hovering is not applicable (tap directly selects)

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Hovered dot ID, event data for that dot
- Outputs: Preview card displayed in left column
- State rules: Hovering shows preview; moving away clears it; clicking locks the card (covered in 2.4)

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Hovering over a dot that's already selected: preview should match the current card (no change)
- Quickly moving mouse across multiple dots: delay prevents rapid flickering
- Hover on dot, then move away: preview clears and left column either shows blank state or reverts to last selected card
- No card data available for hovered dot: show placeholder or error message in preview

**Assumptions:**
- Hover is only available on devices with a mouse pointer (desktop/laptop)
- Preview doesn't affect the arc or footer state
- Preview card uses the same rendering component as the full card (just marked as preview)
- A "selected" card takes precedence over hover preview (if a card is selected, hovering other dots shows previews, but clicking elsewhere doesn't unselect)

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Hover effects on the dot itself (e.g., glow, enlarge) - may be added as polish
- Keyboard navigation (tab to dots) - deferred to accessibility iteration
- Preview animations beyond simple fade/slide
- Preview in the right column (right column only responds to trigger clicks, covered in Epic 3)

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I'm using a desktop browser, when I hover my mouse over a dot on the arc, then I see a preview of that event's card in the left column after a short delay
- Given I hover over a dot and then move to a different dot, when I hover over the second dot, then the preview updates to show the second event's card
- Given I hover over a dot and then move my mouse away from the arc, when I leave the hover area, then the preview clears or reverts to the last selected card
- Given I'm on a mobile device, when I hover or tap a dot, then I do not see a preview (tapping directly selects the card, covered in 2.4)
