### User Story 8.2

**Number:** `8.2`
**ID:** `BA-US-visual-card-type-differentiation`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see immediate visual differences between Event cards and Invention cards so that I can quickly identify card types without reading text, making the game more intuitive and engaging.`

**Context / Background:**
- This story builds on 8.1, which established the data model for card types
- Visual distinction must be kid-friendly and immediately obvious
- Kids aged 7-12 respond well to color coding, icons, and visual patterns
- The game already has established visual design for cards; this extends it with type-specific styling
- Visual differences should appear in all contexts: timeline dots, card panels, album view, mini-game triggers
- Accessibility is critical: color-blind players must be able to distinguish types (use icons + color + patterns)
- Educational value: Visual distinction reinforces the conceptual difference between events (things that happened) and inventions (things that were made)
- Design inspiration: Trading card games (Pokemon, Magic) use color borders and symbols to distinguish card types

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Apply distinct color schemes to Event cards vs Invention cards (e.g., blue for events, orange for inventions)
2. Add type-specific icons to card headers (e.g., clock/calendar icon for events, lightbulb/gear icon for inventions)
3. Use different border styles or patterns for each card type (e.g., solid border for events, dashed for inventions)
4. Display card type label text on card (e.g., "Event" or "Invention" badge)
5. Style timeline dots differently based on card type (color and/or icon)
6. Apply type-specific styling to card panels, album entries, and hover previews
7. Ensure visual distinction is consistent across desktop and mobile views
8. Provide a visual legend or key explaining card type colors/icons (optional, in settings or help)

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Color scheme must be high contrast and accessible (WCAG AA compliant)
- Colors must be distinguishable by color-blind players (use additional indicators like icons/patterns)
- Icons must be simple, recognizable, and age-appropriate (avoid abstract symbols)
- Visual styling must not clutter the card or make text harder to read
- Card type distinction must be obvious within 1 second of viewing
- Styling must work on small mobile screens (icons and colors remain clear)
- Visual design should feel playful and kid-friendly, not clinical or boring
- Performance: CSS styling should not impact rendering speed

**Data & State:**
- Inputs:
  - cardType field from card data ("event" or "invention")
  - Existing card styling (CSS, component structure)
  - Design system colors and icon library
- Outputs:
  - Type-specific CSS classes applied to card elements
  - Rendered cards with distinct colors, borders, and icons
  - Timeline dots styled by card type
  - Album entries visually grouped or distinguished by type
- State rules:
  - Styling is applied automatically based on cardType field
  - Visual theme applies consistently across all views (timeline, card panel, album)
  - If cardType is missing or invalid, default to Event styling
  - User cannot customize card type colors (fixed design for consistency)

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Card with missing cardType: apply default Event styling and log warning
- Card with invalid cardType: apply default Event styling and log error
- Timeline with mixed card types: ensure both types are visually clear when adjacent
- Album view with many cards: ensure colors don't create visual fatigue
- Mobile view with small cards: ensure icons remain visible (may need larger icons or simpler design)
- High contrast mode or accessibility settings: respect user preferences while maintaining type distinction
- Dark mode (if supported): ensure colors work in both light and dark themes
- Player colorblind: icon + pattern + color combination ensures distinction
- Very long card titles: ensure type badge/icon doesn't overlap with text

**Assumptions:**
- Design system allows for custom color schemes per card type
- Icon library includes suitable icons for events (e.g., calendar, clock, star) and inventions (e.g., lightbulb, gear, wrench)
- CSS framework (likely Tailwind CSS based on project) supports type-based styling
- Color choices:
  - Events: Blue/cyan spectrum (suggests time, sky, flow of history)
  - Inventions: Orange/amber spectrum (suggests creativity, innovation, light bulbs)
  - Alternative: Events = purple, Inventions = green (if blue/orange don't test well)
- Icons:
  - Events: Calendar, clock, or star icon
  - Inventions: Lightbulb, gear, or spark icon
- Border styling:
  - Events: Solid border (2-3px)
  - Inventions: Dashed or double border (2-3px)
- Type label badge appears in top-right or top-left corner of card
- Timeline dots use same color scheme (blue dot for events, orange for inventions)
- The game's current design is flexible enough to accommodate styling changes

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Custom themes or player-selectable color schemes
- Animated card type transitions (e.g., sparkle effect on inventions)
- Sound effects when viewing different card types
- 3D or parallax visual effects for card types
- Different card shapes for events vs inventions (both remain rectangular)
- Type-specific background images or textures (colors and icons are sufficient)
- Localization of card type labels (English only for MVP)
- Advanced visual effects for relationships between cards (Story 8.3)
- Visual representation of progression gates (Story 8.4)
- A/B testing different color schemes

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I view an Event card, when I look at its appearance, then I see a blue color scheme, a calendar/clock icon, and an "Event" label
- Given I view an Invention card, when I look at its appearance, then I see an orange color scheme, a lightbulb/gear icon, and an "Invention" label
- Given I view the timeline, when cards of different types are displayed, then Event dots are blue and Invention dots are orange (or similarly distinct)
- Given I hover over a timeline dot, when the preview appears, then the card preview shows the correct type-specific styling
- Given I open a card panel, when the card loads, then the border, header color, and type icon match the card's type
- Given I view the album page, when cards are displayed, then I can immediately distinguish Events from Inventions by visual appearance alone
- Given I am a color-blind player, when I view cards, then I can distinguish types using icons and border patterns (not just color)
- Given I view cards on a small mobile screen, when the cards render, then type icons and colors remain clear and visible
- Given I view multiple cards in a row, when I scan them quickly, then I can identify each card's type within 1 second
- Given I open the game in dark mode (if supported), when cards are displayed, then type colors remain distinct and readable
