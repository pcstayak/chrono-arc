### User Story 4.3

**Number:** `4.3`
**ID:** `BA-US-sample-trigger-content`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see pre-written educational content when I click trigger buttons so that I can learn more about historical events through stories, games, and related information.`

**Context / Background:**
- Each event needs content for each trigger type (story, game, related)
- Content must be educational, accurate, and engaging for kids
- For MVP, content is pre-written and stored with event data
- Story content includes extended text and images
- Game content is a placeholder for MVP
- Related content is a curated list of other events

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Each event in the sample data includes trigger content in the following structure:
   - `story`: {title, text (2-4 paragraphs), images (array of URLs)}
   - `game`: {title, description, placeholder: true}
   - `related`: {title, items (array of related event IDs with brief descriptions)}
2. When a trigger is clicked, load the corresponding content from the event data
3. Render the content appropriately in the right column (text, images, lists)
4. Ensure all content is historically accurate and age-appropriate

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Story text should be at a reading level suitable for grades 3-5 (short sentences, simple vocabulary)
- Story should be engaging and narrative-driven (not just facts)
- Images should be relevant, high-quality, and safe for kids
- Game placeholder should be inviting (e.g., "Coming soon: Test your knowledge with a quiz!")
- Related items should include thumbnails and 1-sentence descriptions

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Selected event, active trigger
- Outputs: Trigger content rendered in right column
- State rules: Content updates when a new trigger is clicked

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Missing story content: display "Story not available"
- Missing images in story: render text only
- No related items: display "No related items found"
- Invalid related item IDs: skip those items, log warning

**Assumptions:**
- Content is pre-written by educators or content creators
- Content is stored in the same data structure as events (or linked by event ID)
- All content is reviewed for accuracy and appropriateness before inclusion
- MVP has at least 2 paragraphs of story content per event

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Dynamically generated content (AI-written stories)
- User-generated content or comments
- Video or audio content (text and images only)
- Fully functional mini-games (MVP has placeholders)
- Interactive quizzes (beyond placeholder)

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I select an event and click the "Story" trigger, when the content loads, then I see 2-4 paragraphs of engaging text and at least one relevant image in the right column
- Given I click the "Game" trigger, when the content loads, then I see a placeholder message (e.g., "Coming soon: Test your knowledge!") in the right column
- Given I click the "Related" trigger, when the content loads, then I see 3-5 related events with thumbnails and brief descriptions in the right column
- Given an event is missing story content, when I click the "Story" trigger, then I see a message "Story not available" in the right column
