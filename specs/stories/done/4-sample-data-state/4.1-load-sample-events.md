### User Story 4.1

**Number:** `4.1`
**ID:** `BA-US-load-sample-events`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want the game to load 5-10 pre-populated historical events when I open it so that I can immediately start exploring the timeline without setup.`

**Context / Background:**
- MVP needs sample data to demonstrate the core functionality
- Events should be diverse and representative of different historical periods
- Each event must have complete data for card display and triggers
- Data should be historically accurate and educational

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Load event data from a JSON file or hardcoded JavaScript object when the game initializes
2. Each event includes the following fields:
   - `id` (unique identifier, e.g., "printing-press")
   - `name` (event name, e.g., "Invention of the Printing Press")
   - `date` (year or era, e.g., 1440 or "15th Century")
   - `arcPosition` (percentage along arc, e.g., 45)
   - `description` (2-4 sentences)
   - `imageUrl` (path to image)
   - `era` (e.g., "Medieval", "Ancient", "Modern")
   - `tags` (array, e.g., ["innovation", "communication"])
   - `triggers` (object with content for "story", "game", "related")
3. Validate that all required fields are present; log errors for incomplete events
4. Make loaded events available to the rendering components (arc, card, right panel)

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Data loading should complete in < 500ms
- Events should span at least 3 different eras
- Content should be age-appropriate (no graphic violence, sensitive topics)
- Images should be appropriate and royalty-free or public domain
- Text should be at a reading level suitable for grades 3-5

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: JSON file or hardcoded data structure
- Outputs: Array of event objects available in application state
- State rules: Events are loaded once on initialization and remain static

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- JSON file missing or inaccessible: log error, show "Failed to load events" message
- Invalid JSON format: log error, show "Data format error" message
- Missing required fields: skip that event, log warning
- Duplicate event IDs: use first occurrence, log warning

**Assumptions:**
- Sample data file is located in a predictable path (e.g., `/data/events.json` or bundled with the app)
- For MVP, data is static (no dynamic fetching from API)
- Images are stored locally or on a reliable CDN
- Historical accuracy is verified before data is finalized

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Admin interface for editing events
- Dynamic data fetching from a backend
- User-uploaded content
- Localization or multiple languages
- Real-time data updates

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I open the game, when the initialization completes, then 5-10 events are loaded into memory and available for display
- Given the data file is present, when the game loads, then all events have the required fields (id, name, date, arcPosition, description, imageUrl, era, tags, triggers)
- Given the data file is missing, when the game loads, then I see an error message indicating data failed to load
- Given the loaded events, when I inspect them, then they span at least 3 different historical eras (e.g., Ancient, Medieval, Modern)
