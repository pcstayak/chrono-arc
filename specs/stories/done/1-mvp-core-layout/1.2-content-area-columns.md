### User Story 1.2

**Number:** `1.2`
**ID:** `BA-US-content-area-columns`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see a two-column content area in the middle of the screen so that I can view a historical card on the left and interact with related content on the right simultaneously.`

**Context / Background:**
- This is the core interaction space for the game
- Left column is the "card panel" - displays one historical event/invention card
- Right column is the "interactive panel" - displays dynamic content based on trigger selections
- Must support both desktop (side-by-side) and mobile (stacked or tabbed) layouts

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Display a left column occupying approximately 35-40% of the content area width on desktop
2. Display a right column occupying approximately 60-65% of the content area width on desktop
3. Left column has a fixed width behavior and always shows one card
4. Right column is dynamic and changes content based on user interaction
5. On mobile/tablet portrait, stack columns vertically or provide tab-based navigation
6. Provide clear visual separation between the two columns (e.g., border, shadow, or spacing)

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Columns must be clearly distinguished visually
- Content within each column should be vertically scrollable if it exceeds the available height
- Minimum column width on desktop: 300px for left, 400px for right
- On mobile, each column should take full width when stacked
- Smooth transitions when switching between desktop and mobile layouts

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Viewport dimensions, selected card data, right panel content type
- Outputs: Rendered two-column layout with appropriate content
- State rules: Layout adapts based on viewport width; column content updates based on user interactions

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Very narrow desktop windows: ensure minimum column widths are respected, add horizontal scroll if necessary
- Very tall content in either column: ensure vertical scrolling works smoothly
- Tablet in landscape: treat as desktop layout
- Tablet in portrait: treat as mobile stacked layout

**Assumptions:**
- Players will primarily interact with one column at a time (left card selection, then right panel interaction)
- Vertical scrolling within columns is acceptable if content is long
- For MVP, stacked mobile layout is sufficient (no complex gesture navigation needed)

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Specific card content or styling (covered in Epic 3)
- Interactive triggers on the card (covered in Epic 3)
- Dynamic content types in the right panel (covered in Epic 3)
- Drag-and-drop between columns (Insert mode, future iteration)

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I open the game on desktop, when the content area loads, then I see two distinct columns side by side with the left column narrower than the right
- Given I open the game on mobile, when the content area loads, then I see a single-column stacked layout with clear separation between left and right content areas
- Given I have long content in the left column, when it exceeds the viewport height, then I can scroll vertically within that column without affecting the right column
- Given I resize from desktop to mobile width, when the transition happens, then the columns smoothly transition from side-by-side to stacked without content loss
