### User Story 1.1

**Number:** `1.1`
**ID:** `BA-US-header-component`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see a clear header with the game title and basic action buttons so that I know what game I'm playing and can access core functions.`

**Context / Background:**
- The header is the top anchor of the UI
- Must be simple and uncluttered for kids
- For MVP, we don't need session info, player count, or mode indicators (those are for multiplayer)
- Focus on branding and essential navigation

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Display the game title "Chrono Arc" prominently in the header
2. Display basic action buttons in the header (e.g., settings icon, help icon)
3. Header must remain visible and fixed at the top as content scrolls (if applicable)
4. On mobile, compress header elements to fit smaller width while maintaining readability

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Title should be large, friendly font suitable for kids (e.g., 24-32px on desktop, 18-24px on mobile)
- Header background should contrast clearly with content area
- Action buttons should be touch-friendly (minimum 44x44px tap targets on mobile)
- Header height approximately 10-12% of viewport height or ~60-80px fixed

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: None for MVP (title is static)
- Outputs: Rendered header with title and buttons
- State rules: Header is always visible

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Very long game title: ensure it doesn't wrap awkwardly on small screens
- Missing button icons: provide text fallback
- Multiple buttons: ensure they don't crowd the header on small screens

**Assumptions:**
- Game title "Chrono Arc" is final and won't change
- Settings and help functions will be implemented in future stories (for now, buttons can be placeholders)
- No user profile or login elements needed

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Session info display (room code, player count) - not needed for single-player MVP
- Mode indicator (Browsing/Insert) - will be added in future iteration
- Actual functionality of settings or help buttons (just UI placeholders)
- User profile, avatar, or username

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I open the game, when the page loads, then I see "Chrono Arc" prominently displayed in the header
- Given I view the header on desktop, when I look at the top of the screen, then I see the title on the left and action buttons on the right with clear spacing
- Given I view the header on mobile, when the page loads, then the title and buttons are compressed but still readable and tappable
- Given I tap on a header action button on mobile, when the tap registers, then the button provides visual feedback (e.g., highlight or press state)
