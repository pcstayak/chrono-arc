### User Story 1.3

**Number:** `1.3`
**ID:** `BA-US-footer-timeline-container`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see a persistent footer containing the timeline arc so that I can always access the timeline visualization and navigate between historical events.`

**Context / Background:**
- The footer contains the core game element: the "Chrono Arc" timeline
- This is a curved, log-like visualization showing historical events as interactive dots
- The footer must always be visible (except in potential future full-screen modes)
- Must be large enough to clearly show the arc and dots, but not dominate the screen

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Display a footer section at the bottom of the viewport occupying approximately 15-20% of the viewport height
2. Footer must remain visible and fixed at the bottom as content in the middle area scrolls
3. Footer must contain the timeline arc visualization (specific arc rendering covered in Epic 2)
4. On mobile, footer may be slightly compressed but must remain functional and visible
5. Provide a clear visual boundary between the footer and the content area above it

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Footer height should be approximately 15-20% of viewport height, minimum ~100px
- Footer background should contrast with the content area
- Arc visualization must be clearly visible against the footer background
- Touch targets for arc interactions must be kid-friendly (covered in Epic 2)
- Footer should not obstruct critical content in the middle area

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Timeline data (events/dots to display on arc)
- Outputs: Rendered footer with arc container
- State rules: Footer is always visible in MVP; arc state reflects current timeline

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Very short viewports: ensure footer doesn't take up too much vertical space (consider min/max constraints)
- Very tall viewports: footer height can scale proportionally but not exceed max reasonable size
- Mobile landscape: footer may need to be slightly smaller to preserve middle content area
- No timeline data: show empty arc with placeholder message

**Assumptions:**
- Timeline arc is the only major element in the footer for MVP
- No need for additional footer navigation or legal text in MVP
- Arc will always have at least a few sample events to display
- Footer doesn't need to be dismissible or collapsible in MVP

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Actual rendering of the arc curve and dots (covered in Epic 2)
- Interactive behaviors on the arc (covered in Epic 2)
- Era markers and zooming functionality (covered in Epic 2)
- Arc animations and state transitions (covered in Epic 2)

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I open the game on desktop, when the page loads, then I see a footer at the bottom taking up approximately 15-20% of the viewport height
- Given I scroll content in the middle area, when I scroll up or down, then the footer remains fixed at the bottom of the screen
- Given I view the game on mobile, when the page loads, then the footer is visible and proportionally sized, not obscuring critical middle content
- Given I resize my browser window vertically, when the height changes, then the footer adjusts its height proportionally while maintaining minimum and maximum constraints
