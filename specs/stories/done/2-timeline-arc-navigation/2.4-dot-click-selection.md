### User Story 2.4

**Number:** `2.4`
**ID:** `BA-US-dot-click-selection`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to click on a dot on the timeline arc to select an event so that the corresponding card is loaded and locked in the left column for further interaction.`

**Context / Background:**
- Clicking a dot is the primary way to select an event for detailed viewing
- Unlike hover preview (temporary), clicking locks the card in the left column
- Once selected, the card's trigger buttons become active (covered in Epic 3)
- The selected dot should be visually highlighted so the player knows which event is active
- This interaction works on both desktop and mobile

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Detect when a player clicks or taps on a dot on the arc
2. Load the corresponding event card in the left column and lock it in place
3. Visually highlight the selected dot (e.g., border, glow, or color change)
4. If another dot is clicked, deselect the previous dot and select the new one
5. Ensure the selected card remains in the left column even if the player hovers over other dots (hover shows preview, but doesn't replace the selected card until another click)
6. On mobile, tapping a dot should immediately select it (no hover preview)

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Click/tap detection should be immediate and reliable
- Visual highlight on the selected dot should be clear and unambiguous
- Card loading should be fast (no noticeable delay)
- Transition from preview (if hovering) to selected card should be smooth
- Tap target on mobile must be large enough for kids (minimum 32px diameter)

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Clicked dot ID, event data for that dot
- Outputs: Selected card displayed in left column, selected dot highlighted on arc
- State rules: Only one dot can be selected at a time; selecting a new dot deselects the previous one

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Clicking the same dot twice: no change (card remains selected, highlight remains)
- Clicking a dot while hovering another: selected card replaces hover preview, clicked dot is highlighted
- No card data for clicked dot: show error message in left column, do not highlight dot
- Rapid clicks on multiple dots: ensure state updates correctly and only the last clicked dot is selected

**Assumptions:**
- Clicking/tapping is the primary selection mechanism
- Only one event can be selected at a time (no multi-select for MVP)
- Selected state persists until another dot is clicked (no "deselect" action)
- Selected card displays in the left column using the full card rendering (not preview mode)

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Keyboard navigation or accessibility focus states (deferred)
- Animation of the card sliding into the left column (simple instant load is sufficient)
- Right column content (covered in Epic 3)
- Deselect or "clear selection" action (player can just select a different dot)

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I click on a dot on the arc, when the click registers, then the corresponding event card loads in the left column and the dot is visually highlighted
- Given I have a dot selected and I click a different dot, when the second click registers, then the previous dot is unhighlighted, the new dot is highlighted, and the left column shows the new event card
- Given I'm on a mobile device and I tap a dot, when the tap registers, then the card loads immediately without a hover preview
- Given I click a dot and then hover over other dots, when I hover, then previews may appear, but the selected card remains locked in the left column until I click a different dot
