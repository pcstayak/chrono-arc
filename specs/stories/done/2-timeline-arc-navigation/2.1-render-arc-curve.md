### User Story 2.1

**Number:** `2.1`
**ID:** `BA-US-render-arc-curve`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see a smooth, upward-curving timeline arc in the footer so that I have a visual representation of time flowing from past to present.`

**Context / Background:**
- The arc is the central visual metaphor of the game
- It should resemble a soft upward curve (like a gentle hill or rainbow arc)
- The curve provides a pleasing visual and helps kids understand time progression
- Arc should be rendered using web graphics (SVG or Canvas)

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Render a Bezier or similar smooth curve stretching horizontally across the footer
2. Curve should start low on the left (ancient history), arc upward in the middle, and end slightly lower on the right (modern day)
3. Curve should be responsive: scale width and height based on footer dimensions
4. Curve should be a visible stroke (line) with a color that contrasts with the footer background
5. Arc should be centered vertically within the footer with padding above and below

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Curve must be smooth with no visible jagged edges or pixelation
- Stroke width should be approximately 3-5px, visible but not overwhelming
- Curve color should be kid-friendly and readable (e.g., dark blue, teal, or brown on light background)
- Arc height (vertical extent of curve) should be approximately 50-70% of footer height
- Rendering should be performant (no lag or jank when resizing)

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Footer width and height
- Outputs: Rendered arc curve
- State rules: Arc curve is static (doesn't change based on interactions)

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Very narrow viewports: curve should compress horizontally but remain smooth
- Very wide viewports: curve should extend but maintain pleasing proportions
- Footer resize: curve should re-render smoothly
- No support for curve rendering: provide fallback (e.g., straight line)

**Assumptions:**
- SVG is the preferred rendering method for scalability and ease of manipulation
- Curve parameters (start point, control points, end point) are pre-defined for MVP
- Curve does not need to be user-customizable
- Curve does not animate on load (static render is sufficient)

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Era markers or labels on the arc
- Interactive hotspots on the curve itself (only dots are interactive)
- Dynamic curve shape based on event density
- Animated curve drawing on page load

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I open the game on desktop, when the footer renders, then I see a smooth upward-curving arc stretching horizontally across the footer
- Given I view the arc on mobile, when the footer renders, then the arc scales to fit the narrower width while maintaining a smooth curve
- Given I resize my browser window, when the footer dimensions change, then the arc re-renders smoothly to fit the new dimensions
- Given the arc is rendered, when I inspect it visually, then the curve is smooth with no pixelation or jagged edges
