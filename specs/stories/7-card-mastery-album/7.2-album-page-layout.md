### User Story 7.2

**Number:** `7.2`
**ID:** `BA-US-album-page-layout`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to view a beautiful album page for each event card that displays collectible elements (stickers, animations, fun facts) in both locked and unlocked states so that I can see my progress and what I can still collect.`

**Context / Background:**
- The album page is the core visual experience of the card mastery system
- It should feel like opening a physical collectible sticker album, familiar and exciting for kids
- Each event card has its own album page with unique collectible elements
- Elements are displayed in a grid or organized layout, clearly showing locked vs unlocked status
- This story focuses on the layout and display, not the unlock mechanics (covered in story 7.3)
- Educational value: Repeated exposure to event-related visuals and facts reinforces learning
- Fun factor: Visual progress tracking creates a sense of achievement and collection

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Create an album page view that displays when the "Album" button is clicked
2. Render a grid or organized layout of collectible elements for the selected card
3. Display three types of elements: stickers (images), animations (GIFs/SVGs), and fun facts (text)
4. Visually distinguish locked elements from unlocked elements
5. Show locked elements as silhouettes, grayed-out placeholders, or with lock icons
6. Show unlocked elements in full detail (images visible, animations playing, facts readable)
7. Display progress indicator (e.g., "5/12 unlocked" or progress bar)
8. Provide navigation to return to the main card view

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Album page must be visually appealing with bright colors and playful design suitable for kids 7-12
- Layout must be responsive and work on desktop (two-column layout) and mobile (single column or grid)
- Touch targets for tappable elements (if any) must be at least 44x44px
- Locked elements should create curiosity without causing frustration (show hints about what they are)
- Page should load quickly even with many elements (optimize images, lazy load if needed)
- Animations should auto-play when unlocked but not be distracting or cause performance issues
- Fun facts text must be readable (minimum 14px font size, high contrast)
- Page should handle varying numbers of elements gracefully (2-20 elements)

**Data & State:**
- Inputs:
  - Event card ID (to load the correct album)
  - Album element definitions (type, image/text, unlock condition label)
  - Player's unlock status for each element (locked/unlocked boolean)
- Outputs:
  - Rendered album page with all elements in appropriate states
  - Progress count and percentage
- State rules:
  - Album page is specific to one event card at a time
  - Element states are read from player progress data (not editable on this page)
  - Unlocked animations play on loop or on hover/tap
  - Locked elements show a generic placeholder, not the actual content

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Card has no album elements defined: show message "This card's album is not ready yet" with friendly illustration
- All elements are locked: show encouraging message like "Complete challenges to unlock these treasures!"
- All elements are unlocked: show celebratory message "You've mastered this card!" with visual flair
- Album has only one type of element (e.g., only stickers, no animations or facts): layout adapts to show uniform grid
- Very long fun fact text: truncate with "read more" button or scroll if needed
- Image fails to load for a sticker: show placeholder image with error icon
- Player has no internet connection: show cached album state if available, or loading/error message
- Mobile landscape orientation: adapt layout to fit horizontal space

**Assumptions:**
- Album element data is stored in the database or loaded with event data
- Each element has a unique ID within the card's album
- Element types are predefined: "sticker", "animation", "fact"
- Unlock status is stored per player per element (boolean flag)
- Progress calculation is simple: count of unlocked elements / total elements
- Locked element placeholders are generic (not custom per element)
- Animations are lightweight (under 500KB each, ideally under 100KB)
- Fun facts are short (max 3 sentences, approximately 150 characters)

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Unlock mechanics or triggering unlocks (covered in story 7.3)
- Interactive elements beyond viewing (e.g., zooming, dragging stickers)
- Sharing or exporting album content
- Sound effects when viewing unlocked elements
- Customizing the album layout or theme
- Comparing albums with other players
- Hints or clues about how to unlock locked elements (may add in future)
- Album-wide achievements or badges

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I click the "Album" button on a card, when the album page loads, then I see a grid or layout of collectible elements
- Given an element is unlocked, when I view the album, then the element is displayed in full detail (image, animation, or fact text)
- Given an element is locked, when I view the album, then I see a placeholder (silhouette, grayed-out icon, or lock symbol)
- Given I view the album page, when I look at the top, then I see a progress indicator showing how many elements I've unlocked out of the total
- Given I have unlocked some stickers and some facts, when I view the album, then both types of elements are clearly labeled or visually distinct
- Given an unlocked animation is displayed, when I view it, then it plays automatically or on hover/tap
- Given I view the album on mobile, when I scroll, then the layout is responsive and all elements are accessible
- Given I want to return to the card view, when I look for navigation, then I see a clear back button or close icon
