### User Story 7.1

**Number:** `7.1`
**ID:** `BA-US-multiple-card-buttons`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see multiple interaction buttons on each event card so that I can choose between different ways to engage with the card, such as playing a game, viewing the album, or exploring related content.`

**Context / Background:**
- Currently, event cards have a single "Game" button that launches different content based on card status
- This story adds a button bar or button group with multiple options
- Initial buttons include: "Game", "Album", and potentially "Story" or "Related"
- The "Game" button retains its existing behavior (launches mini-games or defense mode)
- The "Album" button opens the new album page (implemented in story 7.2)
- Button availability may depend on card state or player progress
- Educational value: Multiple interaction modes encourage exploration from different angles
- UX goal: Clear, intuitive navigation that doesn't overwhelm young players

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Replace the single "Game" button with a horizontal button bar containing multiple buttons
2. Display at least two buttons: "Game" and "Album"
3. Each button triggers a different interaction mode when clicked
4. "Game" button retains existing behavior (load mini-game or defense based on card status)
5. "Album" button triggers navigation to the album page (interface defined in story 7.2)
6. Buttons should have clear, kid-friendly labels and icons
7. Highlight or indicate the currently active interaction mode if applicable

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Buttons must be large enough for kids to tap easily on mobile (minimum 44x44px touch targets)
- Button labels must be short, simple, and easy to read (6-12 year old reading level)
- Icons should be intuitive and complement the text labels
- Button bar should work on both desktop and mobile layouts without breaking
- Buttons should have hover and active states for visual feedback
- Disabled buttons (if any) should be clearly visually distinct and non-clickable
- Button bar should fit within the card layout without requiring horizontal scrolling

**Data & State:**
- Inputs:
  - Event card data (to determine which buttons to show)
  - Card status (safe/threatened/attacked, affects "Game" button behavior)
  - Player progress (may affect button availability in future)
- Outputs:
  - Rendered button bar with appropriate buttons
  - User action when a button is clicked (navigation or mode change)
- State rules:
  - All buttons are always visible and enabled for MVP (future: conditional availability)
  - Clicking a button changes the content displayed in the right panel or navigates to a new view
  - Button states persist during the session (e.g., if album is open, "Album" button is highlighted)

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Very long button labels: truncate or abbreviate if necessary, test on narrow screens
- Rapid clicking on buttons: debounce to prevent multiple simultaneous mode switches
- Card has no album content yet: "Album" button is still visible but shows empty state when clicked
- Mobile in portrait mode: buttons may stack vertically or shrink to fit
- Accessibility: buttons must be keyboard-navigable (tab order, enter to activate)
- Three or more buttons in future: layout should accommodate additional buttons gracefully

**Assumptions:**
- The event card component has a designated area for interaction buttons
- Each button triggers a clearly defined action (no ambiguous behavior)
- Button actions are handled by the parent component or state manager
- Icons for buttons are available in the project (or can use text-only labels initially)
- Right panel or navigation system can display different content based on button clicks
- Button labels are in English and will be localized later if needed

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Dynamic button availability based on player progress or permissions
- Custom button configurations per card
- Animated transitions between modes
- Tooltips or help text explaining what each button does
- Badge notifications on buttons (e.g., "New!" or unlock counts)
- Reordering or customizing button layout by players
- Context menus or long-press actions on buttons

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I view an event card, when I look at the interaction area, then I see a button bar with at least "Game" and "Album" buttons
- Given I click the "Game" button, when the click registers, then the game section loads (existing behavior)
- Given I click the "Album" button, when the click registers, then the album page view is triggered
- Given I am on desktop, when I hover over a button, then the button shows a hover state (color change or highlight)
- Given I am on mobile, when I tap a button, then the button responds with visual feedback before triggering the action
- Given I have opened the album, when I click the "Game" button, then the view switches from album to game
- Given the button bar has three or more buttons, when displayed on a narrow screen, then all buttons remain visible and tappable
