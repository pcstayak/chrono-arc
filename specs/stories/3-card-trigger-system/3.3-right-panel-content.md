### User Story 3.3

**Number:** `3.3`
**ID:** `BA-US-right-panel-content`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see relevant educational content in the right column when I click a trigger button so that I can explore the selected event in depth through stories, games, or related information.`

**Context / Background:**
- The right column is the dynamic content area that changes based on trigger selection
- For MVP, we'll implement 3 content types: Story/Context, Mini-game placeholder, Related Items
- Content should be educational and engaging for kids
- This is where deeper learning happens beyond the basic card info

**Functional Requirements:**
1. When the "Story/Context" trigger is clicked, display extended text, images, or media about the event in the right column
2. When the "Mini-game" trigger is clicked, display a placeholder or simple interactive element (actual game implementation is future work)
3. When the "Related Items" trigger is clicked, display a list or grid of related events/inventions with brief descriptions
4. Right column content should be scrollable if it exceeds the available height
5. Provide a clear heading or title in the right column indicating which trigger is active (e.g., "Story: The Printing Press")

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Content should be readable and engaging for kids (appropriate font size, spacing, visuals)
- Story content should include at least one image or illustration
- Mini-game placeholder should be interactive (e.g., "Coming soon" message with a sample button)
- Related items should have thumbnails and short descriptions
- Right column should provide smooth scrolling if content is long
- Content should load quickly (no noticeable delay)

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Selected event ID, active trigger type
- Outputs: Rendered content in right column based on trigger
- State rules: Right column content updates when a new trigger is clicked; only one content type is shown at a time

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Missing content for a trigger: display "Content not available" message
- Very long story text: ensure scrolling works smoothly
- No related items: display "No related items found"
- Images fail to load: show placeholder or alt text
- Mobile: ensure content is readable and doesn't overflow

**Assumptions:**
- For MVP, story content is pre-written (2-4 paragraphs) with at least one image
- Mini-game is a placeholder (not a fully functional game)
- Related items are manually curated (3-5 related events per event)
- Content is stored as structured data (e.g., JSON) and rendered dynamically

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Fully functional mini-games (MVP has placeholders only)
- User-generated content or comments
- Video or audio content (images and text only for MVP)
- Interactive quizzes (beyond placeholder)
- Dynamic related item recommendations based on player behavior

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I click the "Story/Context" trigger, when the content loads, then I see extended text and images about the event in the right column
- Given I click the "Mini-game" trigger, when the content loads, then I see a placeholder message or simple interactive element in the right column
- Given I click the "Related Items" trigger, when the content loads, then I see a list of 3-5 related events with thumbnails and short descriptions in the right column
- Given the right column content is longer than the viewport, when I scroll, then the content scrolls smoothly without affecting the left column or arc
