### User Story 3.2

**Number:** `3.2`
**ID:** `BA-US-trigger-buttons`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see trigger buttons on the right edge of the event card so that I can click them to access different types of related content in the right column.`

**Context / Background:**
- Trigger buttons are the mechanism for loading content into the right column
- They are positioned vertically along the right edge of the card
- For MVP, we'll implement 2-3 trigger types: "Story/Context", "Mini-game", "Related Items"
- Each trigger loads a different type of content in the right panel
- Only one trigger can be active at a time

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Display 2-3 trigger buttons vertically aligned on the right edge of the card
2. Each button should have a clear label indicating the type of content it will load (e.g., "Story", "Game", "Related")
3. Buttons should be clickable/tappable
4. When a button is clicked, it should become visually highlighted to indicate it's active
5. If another button is clicked, the previous button should be unhighlighted and the new one highlighted
6. On page load, no trigger is active by default (right column shows a prompt or blank state)

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Buttons should be large enough for touch interaction (minimum 44px height, 40px width)
- Button labels should be short and kid-friendly (1-2 words)
- Active button should have a clear visual distinction (e.g., filled background, border, or glow)
- Buttons should have hover states on desktop for discoverability
- Buttons should be accessible (keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly)

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Event object with available triggers (e.g., `triggers: ["story", "game", "related"]`)
- Outputs: Rendered trigger buttons on card, active trigger highlighted
- State rules: Only one trigger can be active at a time; clicking a new trigger deactivates the previous one

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Event has no triggers available: hide trigger button section or show "No additional content"
- Event has only one trigger: display only one button
- Clicking the same trigger twice: no change (trigger remains active, right content remains loaded)
- Mobile: ensure buttons are vertically stacked and tappable

**Assumptions:**
- Each event has at least 2 triggers available for MVP
- Trigger types are predefined: "story", "game", "related" (additional types can be added later)
- Right column content is pre-populated for each trigger (not dynamically generated)
- Triggers are displayed in a consistent order: Story first, Game second, Related third

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Actual content loaded in the right column (covered in 3.3)
- Icons or graphics on trigger buttons (text labels are sufficient for MVP)
- Customizable trigger order or visibility
- Trigger button animations (beyond hover/active states)

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given an event card is displayed, when I look at the right edge of the card, then I see 2-3 trigger buttons vertically aligned
- Given I click a trigger button, when the click registers, then the button is highlighted and the corresponding content loads in the right column
- Given a trigger is active and I click a different trigger, when the second click registers, then the first trigger is unhighlighted, the second is highlighted, and the right column content updates
- Given I'm on mobile, when I view the card, then the trigger buttons are large enough to tap easily and do not overlap
