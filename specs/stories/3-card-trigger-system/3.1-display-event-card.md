### User Story 3.1

**Number:** `3.1`
**ID:** `BA-US-display-event-card`
**Role:** `player`
**Story:** `As a player, I want to see a detailed card for a selected historical event in the left column so that I can read about the event and understand its significance.`

**Context / Background:**
- The card is the primary content display for an individual event
- Must show key information: name, image, short description, metadata (era, tags)
- Card design should be engaging for kids: colorful, clear typography, appropriate imagery
- Card should be scannable: kids should quickly grasp the main info

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Display the event name prominently at the top of the card
2. Display an image or illustration related to the event below the name
3. Display a short description (2-4 sentences) explaining the event
4. Display metadata such as era (e.g., "Ancient", "Medieval", "Modern") and tags (e.g., "innovation", "war", "science")
5. Card should fill the left column vertically but allow scrolling if content is long
6. Use consistent typography and spacing for readability

**Non-Functional / UX Requirements:**
- Event name should be large and bold (e.g., 20-24px font size)
- Image should be appropriately sized (e.g., 100% width of card, aspect ratio 16:9 or 4:3)
- Description text should be readable (e.g., 14-16px font size, good line height)
- Metadata should be visually distinct (e.g., smaller font, muted color, or badge style)
- Card background should contrast with the column background
- Card should have padding and/or borders for visual separation

**Data & State:**
- Inputs: Event object with `{id, name, description, imageUrl, era, tags[]}`
- Outputs: Rendered card in left column
- State rules: One card displayed at a time; card updates when a new event is selected

**Validation & Edge Cases:**
- Missing image: display a placeholder image (e.g., generic historical icon)
- Missing description: display "No description available"
- Very long description: truncate and provide "Read more" button to expand (or scroll)
- Missing metadata: hide metadata section or show "N/A"
- Image fails to load: show broken image placeholder with alt text

**Assumptions:**
- All sample events have at least a name and description
- Images are hosted and accessible via URL
- Image aspect ratios are reasonably consistent across events
- Metadata (era, tags) are optional but recommended

**Out of Scope (for this story):**
- Trigger buttons on the card (covered in 3.2)
- Interactive elements within the description (e.g., links, tooltips)
- Animated transitions when card content changes (simple instant load is sufficient)
- "Favorite" or "bookmark" functionality
- Sharing or exporting card content

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin-style):**
- Given I select an event, when the card loads in the left column, then I see the event name, image, description, and metadata clearly displayed
- Given the event has a valid image URL, when the card loads, then the image is displayed below the event name
- Given the event is missing an image, when the card loads, then a placeholder image is displayed instead
- Given the description is very long, when the card loads, then the text is either truncated with a "Read more" option or the card is scrollable
