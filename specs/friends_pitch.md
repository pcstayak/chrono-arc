It’s a small, web-based family game where you and your kids rebuild human history together. Think “Jackbox-style login on your phones,” but instead of party questions, you’re fixing a scrambled timeline of inventions and events.

You create a session, share the code, and everyone in that session works on one shared timeline. If someone wants to play alone or with a different group, they just start their own session—parallel timelines, same rules.

You start with the big, easy milestones: invention of the wheel, printing press, first flight, landing on the Moon, etc. Kids drag them into the right order, talk it through, and learn the basics of how history fits together.

Once the big pieces are in place, the game starts adding smaller, trickier inventions that must be slotted between the ones you already placed. Each event you place correctly reveals a short bit of context—pictures, a quick animation, or a small text blurb. These aren’t just fun facts; they become clues that help you place the next, more detailed events as the game gradually adds trickier discoveries.

Sometimes “time bandits” try to steal cards back. When you check in, a few events might be “under attack,” and you need to answer simple recall questions to save them. It’s a gentle way to reinforce what you’ve already learned.

The whole point is a light, ongoing activity—something families or small friend groups can dip into a few minutes a day, build a timeline together, and keep the bandits from messing it up.
